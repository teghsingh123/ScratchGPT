### SCRATCH GPT

Uses Scratch cloud variables to connect Groq GPT to Scratch
Good for bypassing ChatGPT block on school computers

How to use:

1. Download the code and install packages in requirements.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt)

2. Upload it to any IDE (VSCODE,e tc.) DO NOT USE REPL.IT. IT DOES NOT WORK AS SCRATCH HAS BANNED THE REPLIT IP FROM LOGGING INTO SCRATCH

3. Make a copy of https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1032093853

4. Create a Groq API for free at https://console.groq.com/keys

5. Copy your API Key

6. RUN main.py

7. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/

8. Enter your Scratch username, password, project id which can be found in the URL, and API_KEY

9. While page is loading, run the Scratch program and enter your prompt

10. Wait around 30 seconds and your answer will be available on Scratch

11. Responses will be a maximum of of 560 Characters so it may cut off at the end. So choose your prompts wisely. (I suggest adding a header of in 30 words ... or something like that)

12. Don't get caught
